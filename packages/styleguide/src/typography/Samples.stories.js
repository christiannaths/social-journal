          This is the most common header. It's a bit bigger than the

          And this is a title

        <Text>
          This is a regular paragraph, also known as "body text". It's
          set at a certain size and then you can adjust from there. It
          may have other elements inside of it, like{' '}
          <em>emphasis text</em>, or{' '}

        <Text>
          <strong>Section Header</strong>
          And this is a paragraph
          <small>Date: Today</small>
        </Text>

        <section>
          <Title>Sample Post</Title>

            How precious the time: Hard to believe a whole month has
            passed by in the start of this brand new year .. So What's
            New - I've signed up for a new course titled Looking Ahead
            To Management, not that I'm particularly looking to become a
            manager but my manager thought it would be good for me ..

            and who should I meet when I arrived .. a former colleague,
            a favourite Italian who the rest of our team used to joke we
            were like an old married couple and we'd consectetur hac
            condimentum lobortis natoque praesent mollis urna vehicula
